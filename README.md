## About

> Gambit was a project I started about 1 year ago (10/20/2019) because I was interested in making a Discord bot for my friends and family Discord server. With the help of some proficient developers from sneaker Twitter, and my own previous knowledge of coding, I scraped together a small little project. Formerly known as FlushedBot, Gambit is an all-in-one Discord bot that can help moderate, manage, and bring fun and useful commands to the servers it joins. 

# Commands

# Miscellaneous
 
 * To get the bot to function you will need to input a Discord Bot token into the `.env` file. If you don't know how to get this token, click [here](https://youtu.be/j_sD9udZnCk?t=529).

* If you will be downloading this repository, the `package.json` has the script to start the bot as `node .`

* Before running the bot, make sure to check the `config.json` file and input all the necessary values.

* Not all commands may be fully functional as they may have deprecated code, bad API's, etc. Please open up an issue if any of the commands don't result in the bot responding. 
* Pull requests are appreciated, and would help continue the development of this bot. 
* You can add this bot to your server **[here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=674028761347522569&permissions=8&scope=bot)**. The bot is hosted on Heroku so there will be downtimes as I don't have enough to pay for a server with close to 0 downtime.
