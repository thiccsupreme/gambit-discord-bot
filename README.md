# Gambit Discord Bot

## About

> Gambit was a project I started about 1 year ago (10/20/2019) because I was interested in making a Discord bot for my fnf Discord server. With the help of some proficient developers from sneaker Twitter, and my own previous knowledge of coding, I scraped together a small little project. Formerly known as FlushedBot, Gambit is an all-in-one Discord bot that can help moderate, manage, and bring fun and useful commands to the servers it joins.
