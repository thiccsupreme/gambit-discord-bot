> Gambit was a project I started in October of 2019 as I was overcome with an interest to develop Discord bots for my friends and family Discord server. With the help of some proficient developers that am friends with, and my own previous knowledge of coding, I scraped together a small little project. Formerly known as FlushedBot, Gambit is a multi-functional, sneaker-botting oriented Discord bot that can help moderate, manage, entertain, and inform it's users. Providing the cleanest, sleekest, most in-depth, and best developed commands, Gambit is *the* best Discord bot to add into your server! The repo is open to anyone for use, and in the Miscellaneous section of this file is a hyperlink to add this bot into any server!

# <p align=center>Miscellaneous üöÄ
 
* Not all commands may be fully functional as they may have deprecated code, bad API's, etc. Please open up an issue if any of the commands don't result in the bot responding, or contact me directly. My information is in the footer of this `README` file.  
* Pull requests are appreciated, and would help continue the development of this bot. 
* You can add this bot to your server **[here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=674028761347522569&permissions=8&scope=bot)**. The bot is hosted on Heroku so there will be downtimes as I don't have enough to pay for a server with close to 0 downtime. 

Currently in the works:
